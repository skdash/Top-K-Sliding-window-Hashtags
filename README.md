# Top-K-Sliding-window-Hashtags
Display of Top-K hashtags from twitter stream in a dynamically configurable sliding window and K

Installation

The assignment is designed on a web client-server architecture implemented on NodeJS server as backend service and Jade view engine as frontend. 

1. Installation of NodeJS

Execute the following instructions to install Node web server.
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git-core curl build-essential openssl
libssl-dev
git clone https://github.com/joyent/node.git && cd node
./configure
make
sudo make install

Also install node-express-generator by the following command:
sudo npm install -g express-generator

To install external modules to be used by Node, use NPM. The provided file "package.json" has the required modules to be installed. The following command when executed installs all the modules listed in the file:
npm install

2. Installation of Jade, Jquery and Twitter bootstrap

cd $HOME # move to home directory
sudo npm set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/
sudo npm install -g jade # option -g: install globally
sudo npm install -g bower # pkg manager, http://bower.io
bower install -g jquery
bower install bootstrap

3. Set environment variables

Please add the following lines to the file '$HOME/.bashrc' as environment variables:
export TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=*****************************
export TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=****************************
export TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=**************************
export TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET=*****************************

4. Installing countminsketch and twit

npm install count-min-sketch
npm install twit

Compilation

Running the server

1. Extract the submitted archived file
2. Open a terminal session and move to directory 'src' (cd src)
3. Run the command: node app.js

Running the client

1. Open web-browser (chrome/firefox)
2. View the initial results on: http://localhost:3000. The initial list of hashtags is based on the values of k=5 and window size=20.
3. Values of k and window size are dynamically configurable and could be provided as input in the dedicated text area and on clicking 'Submit' results are displayed.

The working is based on the below assumptions:
1. The number of hashtags (k) to be displayed has a default value of 5.
2. The window size is based on the number of tweets received. The window slides by 1 upon receiving a tweet beyond the initial window size.
Example: Default window size is 20. So, the initial list of hashtags is considered from the tweets #1 to #20, followed by tweets #2 to #21 and so on.
3. The top-k hashtags are loaded onto the browser screen starting from 1 to k. It doesn't wait for the count to become k to be displayed.
4. While changing the values of wither k or window size on the client side (browser), both the values are assumed to be supplied before clicking 'Submit' button. If a change is desired in only one of the parameters, then either supply the default parameter value or the already existing value in the textbox for the other parameter. Leaving a textbox as blank before clicking 'Submit' will result in a crash of the server.
